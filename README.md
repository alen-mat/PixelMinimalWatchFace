### Project idea

I made this Watch Face mainly for my own use: I was looking for a "Google Pixel like" Watch Face that is minimal and feel stock. After some research, I couldn't find anything that was meeting my needs:
- Minimalist design, inspired by Google Pixel
- Battery efficient
- Support for complications

This is why I created Pixel Minimal Watch Face, with the secret hope that some folks will also like it. 

Part of this project is inspired by [Cole Gerdemann](https://github.com/CorvetteCole) work, please check his GitHub if you want to know more.
